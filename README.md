# Drink Master Backend

The Drink Master backend serves as the backbone of the Drink Master application, facilitating seamless interactions between users and the extensive database of drink recipes. Designed to provide a robust and secure environment, the backend enables users to explore, contribute, and personalize their drink collections.

## Lessons Learned

- Authentication Complexity: Implementing authentication with two tokens posed a challenge initially due to its complexity. However, by breaking down the process into smaller steps and referring to documentation and tutorials, I was able to grasp the concept and implement it successfully.

- Router Module Structure: Structuring router modules with children routes required careful planning to ensure a logical organization of endpoints. I overcame this challenge by sketching out the module structure beforehand and seeking advice from experienced developers.

- NestJS Learning Curve: Learning NestJS and its conventions took some time, especially for someone with limited prior experience. To overcome this, I dedicated time to studying the framework's documentation, following tutorials, and experimenting with sample projects until I felt comfortable with its concepts.
